## Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I received a PhD in Italian literature from Johns Hopkins University in 2017, after which I worked as an academic researcher in the US, France, and Germany until 2020. During my time in academia I collaborated on several digital humanities projects including [The Archaeology of Reading](bookwheel.org/) and [Literary Polemics of the Renaissance](https://obvil.sorbonne-universite.fr/projets/gongora-et-les-querelles-litteraires-de-la-renaissance), both of which focused on novel approaches to engaging with pre-modern books through digital tools. Since then I've shifted towards a career more firmly rooted in the field of software development. From January to March 2021 I took part in [Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/munich) in Munich, which introduced me to the fun of using Ruby on Rails. After that I participated in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) from May to August 2021, where I then discovered the joys of compilers and low-level programming. At the moment I'm working as a software engineer at [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/).
